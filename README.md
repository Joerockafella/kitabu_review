Kitabu review

This is a Book review app. Users are able to register and then log in using their username and password. 
Once they log in, they are able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. 
In addition there is a third-party API by Goodreads (another book review app), that is being used,  to pull in ratings from a broader audience. 
Finally, users are able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via this appâ€™s API.

This is one of the projects that cs50(HarvardX) requires to finish in order to obtain a certificate.
